# IoT for EyeoT: Arduino 101 BLE Assistive Devices
(TODO: Explanation)

## Download & Build Instructions:

0. (These instructions assume you have already installed the Arduino IDE found [here] (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)). 

1. To install this Arduino sketch and all its dependencies in one download, navigate to the directory where your **Arduino** project folder is (the one containing the **libraries** folder. 

2. Issue `git clone https://github.com/EyeoT/IoT.git Arduino-temp`. 

3. Copy over its entire contents into your existing **Arduino** directory. This centralizes all of your Arduino sketches, and enables you to use your own libraries on this project if you exempt them from our **.gitignore** file. 

4. When prompted, merge all of this sketch's files. You may now delete the temporary **Arduino-temp** folder.

5. Open `Arduino_101_BLE_EyeoT.ino` in the Arduino IDE, then selec **Tools > Board: ** and select **Arduino/Genuino 101*.

6. Verify, Upload, and you're good to go!
